# Specification Quality Checklist: Production Quality Codebase Refactoring

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items passed. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

**Validation Summary**:
- 4 user stories defined with clear priorities (P1-P4)
- 12 functional requirements with testable criteria
- 10 measurable success criteria (technology-agnostic)
- Edge cases identified (7 scenarios)
- Scope clearly defined (in-scope and out-of-scope items listed)
- Assumptions documented (7 items)
- No clarification markers - all requirements are clear and actionable
